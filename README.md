📉 Churn Prediction Template
This template helps you analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning models. Designed for SaaS, telecom, or subscription-based businesses, this template is beginner-friendly and can be customized for any dataset.

📌 Objective
Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) using historical customer data. This can help businesses reduce churn rate by targeting at-risk customers with proactive actions.

📁 Dataset Used
Name: Telco Customer Churn
Source: Kaggle Dataset
Features:
Demographics (gender, senior citizen)
Account information (tenure, contract, payment method)
Usage behavior (monthly charges, total charges)
Target: Churn (Yes/No)
🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python
pandas, numpy
seaborn, matplotlib
scikit-learn (for ML)
Jupyter Notebook
🔍 Steps Included
1. Import Libraries
Import the necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

2. Load Dataset
Load and display the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

3. Data Cleaning
Remove missing values
Convert TotalCharges to numeric
Drop unneeded columns like customerID
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand distribution of target column (Churn)
Analyze correlations and relationships between features
5. Data Preprocessing
Convert categorical variables using one-hot encoding
Split data into training and test sets
6. Model Training
Use RandomForestClassifier to build a classification model that predicts churn.

7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
Visualize results for better interpretation
📈 Example Output
Accuracy Score: ~79–83%
Top Features:
MonthlyCharges
Contract type
Tenure
Graphical Outputs:
Confusion Matrix
Churn vs Non-Churn distribution

🧠 How to Use This Template
Upload your customer dataset (must contain a churn column).
Clean and preprocess it using the given steps.
Train a model using the template code.
Analyze performance and tune as needed.
Export predictions or integrate into business dashboards.

💡 Use Cases
Telecom churn reduction
SaaS subscription management
User retention strategies
Customer lifetime value prediction

🚀 Future Improvements
Add feature importance visualizations
Try other models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
Add hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Create an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit)
